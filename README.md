# Welcome to Complexity

Complexity, or the reduction of same, is all about doing the least work possible in the easiest place. Perhaps we should have called it Laziness!

In this module you will do a lot of refactoring. You will get the most out of this module if you proactively review each others code and help each other make it simpler and more efficient. The goal is not to write "your" code perfectly in one go, but to develop a habit of iteratively improving "the" code with informed, strategic refactors. So the more reviews you do, the more you will get out of this module.
