# Implement a linked list

Implement a linked list data structure in Python.

It should support the following operations. Each operation should have a O(1) worst-case time complexity.

* `push_head` should add an element to the start of the list. It should return something that can be passed to `remove` to remove that element in the future.
* `pop_tail` should remove an element from the end of the list.
* `remove` takes a handle from `push_head`, and removes that element from the list.

There are some tests in `linked_list_test.py` for your implementation - feel free to write more.
