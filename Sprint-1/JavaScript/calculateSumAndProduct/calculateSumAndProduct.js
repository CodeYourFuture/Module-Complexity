 *   "product": 30 // 2 * 3 * 5

 * @param {Array<number>} numbers - Numbers to process
 * @returns {Object} Object containing running total and product

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// The original implementation also had O(n) time complexity,
// but it iterated through the array twice (approximately 2n operations).
// The refactored version calculates both the sum and product in one loop,
// so it only traverses the array once (approximately n iterations).
//
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// We only store two variables regardless of the size of the input.
// Optimal Time Complexity: O(n)
// We must iterate through every element at least once
// to calculate both the sum and the product.
