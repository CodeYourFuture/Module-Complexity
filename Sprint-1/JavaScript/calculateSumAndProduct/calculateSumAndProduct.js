/**
 * Calculate the sum and product of integers in a list
 *
 * Note: the "sum" is every number added together
 * and the "product" is every number multiplied together
 * so for example: [2, 3, 5] would return
 * {
 *   "sum": 10, // 2 + 3 + 5
 *   "product": 30 // 2 * 3 * 5
 * }
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) because this code has 2 loops that are separated from each other
 * Space Complexity: O(n) for input array and O(1) for variables and loops, which result in O(n) in total
 * Optimal Time Complexity: O(n) I think this algorithm is efficient enough
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} numbers - Numbers to process
 * @returns {Object} Object containing running total and product
