Time Complexity:

Outer loop: i goes from 0 to n-1 = O(n)

Inner loop: j goes from i+1 to n-1 = O(n) (in worst case)

total comparison = n * (n - 1) / 2 

Therefor total complexity = O(nÂ²)

Space Complexity:

not creating new lists, sets, or hash maps. Only using loop variables i, j, and a few constants.

Space Complexity: O(1)

## Optimal for Time complexity. Reduces it to O(n), but increases the space complexity to O(n).
