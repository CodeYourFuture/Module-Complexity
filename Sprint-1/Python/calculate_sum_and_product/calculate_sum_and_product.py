    """
    Calculate the sum and product of integers in a list.

    Note: the sum is every number added together
    and the product is every number multiplied together
    so for example: [2, 3, 5] would return
    {
        "sum": 10, // 2 + 3 + 5
        "product": 30 // 2 * 3 * 5
    }
    Time Complexity:
     There were two loops, one for each operation. Each has complexity O(n)
     for both loops, complexity is O(2n)
    Space Complexity:
        space is constant O(1)
    Optimal time complexity:
        With only one loop for both operations reduce complexity to o(1)
